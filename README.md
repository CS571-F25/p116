# 🧑‍🍳 SmartRecipe: AI-powered Recipe Generator

SmartRecipe is an AI-powered web application that helps users decide what to cook using the ingredients they already have. By entering a few ingredients, users can instantly generate personalized recipes, view nutritional details, and explore different cooking styles and dietary preferences. For example, if a user inputs “tomato,” “beef,” and “potato”, AI may suggest recipes such as Beef Stew with Tomatoes or Spiced Beef and Potato Hash. The goal is to make cooking more accessible, creative, and efficient, especially for students and busy professionals who often wonder “What should I cook today?”
