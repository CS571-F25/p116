# 🧑‍🍳 SmartRecipe: AI-powered Recipe Generator

SmartRecipe is an AI-powered web application that helps users decide what to cook using the ingredients they already have. By entering a few ingredients, users can instantly generate personalized recipes, view nutritional details, and explore different cooking styles and dietary preferences. For example, if a user inputs “tomato,” “beef,” and “potato”, AI may suggest recipes such as Beef Stew with Tomatoes or Spiced Beef and Potato Hash. The goal is to make cooking more accessible, creative, and efficient, especially for students and busy professionals who often wonder “What should I cook today?”

## ✨ Features

- **Recipe Generation:** Users input their available ingredients, and AI generates three recipe options displayed as interactive cards. Each card features a title, image, brief description, preparation time, difficulty level, calorie count, and relevant dietary tags.
- **Recipe Details:** By clicking the recipe card, users can view recipe details including ingredient lists, step-by-step instructions, nutrition facts, and helpful cooking tips.
- **Save/Favorite Recipes:** Users can save or remove favorite recipes to their personal “Saved Recipes” page and search or filter through their collection.
- **Preference Modes:** Users can filter recipes by dietary restriction (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), cuisine style (e.g., Asian, Italian), meal type, cooking complexity, and spice level to match their specific needs.
